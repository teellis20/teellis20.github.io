Another thing my hometown is famous for, is their special chili called Skyline, which I miss almost every single day. From Cincinnati, I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where I met my Fiancee and lived for about 4 years. More recently, we moved to Seattle where we now share our home with a brand new poodle puppy named Sirius!</p>

            <p>I have my degree in Psychology, but currently work at Geico as a liability claims adjuster. My hope is to one day make the switch to web and app development and once I retire, teach kids the wonderful ways of coding. </p>

            <p>In my spare time I like to play video games, take pictues, go hiking and frequent sporting events. </p>
